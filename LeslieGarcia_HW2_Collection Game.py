@Python Version: 3.11

@Required Modules: 
import sys  # For exiting the program gracefully with sys.exit()
import time       # (Optional) To add delays for better user experience
import random     # (Optional) For hint feature (randomly show a remaining item)

@Description: Build a program using: Dictionaries for metadata, Lists to hold collections,User-defined functions, Loops and logic control, and Type checking

# Clears ensures no new line and ensures immediate print
## Sequence of commands to the terminal which clears the screen and moves the cursor to the top-left
### Effectively providing a clean slate.
